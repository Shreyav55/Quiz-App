PROJECT OVERVIEW 

The Quiz App is a simple and interactive web application built using React.js. It allows users to test their knowledge by answering multiple-choice questions.
The app starts with a "Start Quiz" button, followed by a series of questions where users can select their answers. After selecting an option, they can proceed to the next question using the "Next" button. At the end of the quiz, the app displays the final score and provides a "Try Again" button to restart the quiz.

The project follows a clean and modern UI, inspired by mobile quiz applications, and features smooth transitions between questions. It also ensures that only one answer can be selected per question and randomizes the order of answer options for fairness.

Dynamic UI updates as users progress through the quiz
